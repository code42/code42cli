The Code42 command-line interface (CLI) tool offers a way to interact with your Code42 environment without using the 
Code42 console or making API calls directly. For example, you can use it to extract Code42 data for use in a security 
information and event management (SIEM) tool or manage users on the High Risk Employees list or Departing Employees 
list. This article provides instructions for installing, uninstalling, and upgrading the Code42 CLI. 

## Requirements
To use the Code42 CLI, you must have:

A Code42 Diamond or Platinum product plan 
Endpoint monitoring enabled in the Code42 console 
Python version 2.7.x, or 3.5 and later installed
