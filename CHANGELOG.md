# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The intended audience of this file is for py42 consumers -- as such, changes that don't affect
how a consumer would use the library (e.g. adding unit tests, updating documentation, etc) are not captured here.

## 1.4.0 - 2021-03-09

### Added

- `code42cli.extensions` module exposes `sdk_options` decorator and `script` group for writing custom extension scripts
    using the Code42 CLI.

    - `code42 security-data send-to`
    - `code42 alerts send-to`
    - `code42 audit-logs send-to`
  for more securely transporting data. Included are new flags:

    - `cases create` sets a name that already exists in the system.

    - `remove` to remove an event from a case.
    - `list` to view all events associated with a case.

### Changed

- The error text when removing an employee from a detection list now references the employee
  by ID rather than the username.

- Improved help text for date option arguments.

## 1.1.0 - 2020-12-18

### Fixed

- Issue where `code42 profile delete` was allowed without giving a `profile_name` even
  though deleting the default profile is not allowed.

### Added

- `code42 audit-logs` commands:
    - `search` to search for audit-logs.
    - `send-to` to send audit-logs to server.

### Changed

- `profile_name` argument is now required for `code42 profile delete`, as it was meant to be.

- The `--advanced-query` option on `alerts search` and `security-data (search|send-to)` commands has been updated:
    - It can now accept the query as a JSON string or as the path to a file containing the JSON query.
    - It can be used with the `--use-checkpoint/-c` option.

- Now, when adding a cloud alias to a detection list user, such as during `departing-employee add`, it will remove the existing cloud alias if one exists.
    - Before, it would error and the cloud alias would not get added.

## 1.0.0 - 2020-08-31

### Fixed

- Bug where `code42 legal-hold show` would error when terminal was too small.

- Fixed bug in `departing_employee bulk add` command that allowed invalid dates to be passed without validation.

### Changed

- The follow commands now print a nicer error message when trying to remove a user who is not on the list:
    - `code42 departing-employee remove`
    - `code42 high-risk-employee remove`
    - `code42 alert-rules remove-user`

- `-i` (`--incremental`) has been removed, use `-c` (`--use-checkpoint`) with a string name for the checkpoint instead.

- The code42cli has been migrated to the [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com) framework. This brings:
    - BREAKING CHANGE: Commands that accept multiple values for the same option now must have the option flag provided before each value:
        use `--option value1 --option value2` instead of `--option value1 value2` (which was previously possible).
    - Cosmetic changes to error messages, progress bars, and help message formatting.

- The `print` command on the `security-data` and `alerts` command groups has been replaced with the `search` command.
    This was a name change only, all other functionality remains the same.

- A profile created with the `--disable-ssl-errors` flag will now correctly not verify SSL certs when making requests. A warning message is printed
    each time the CLI is run with a profile configured this way, as it is not recommended.

- The `path` positional argument for bulk `generate-template` commands is now an option (`--p/-p`).

- Below `search` subcommands accept argument `--format/-f` to display result in formats `csv`, `table`, `json`, `raw-json`:
    - Default output format is changed to `table` format from `raw-json`, returns a paginated response.
    All properties would be displayed by default except when using `-f table`.
    Pass `--include-all` when using `table` to view all non-nested top-level properties.
    - `code42 alerts search`
    - `code42 security-data search`
    - `code42 security-data saved-search list`
    - `code42 legal-hold list`
    - `code42 alert-rules list`

### Added

- `--or-query` option added to `security-data search` and `alerts search` commands which combines the provided filter arguments into an 'OR' query instead of the default 'AND' query.

- `--password` option added to `profile create` and `profile update` commands, enabling creating profiles while bypassing the interactive password prompt.

- Profiles can now save multiple alert and file event checkpoints. The name of the checkpoint to be used for a given query should be passed to `-c` (`--use-checkpoint`).

- `-y/--assume-yes` option added to `profile delete` and `profile delete-all` commands to not require interactive prompt.

- Below subcommands accept argument `--format/-f` to display result in formats `csv`, `table`, `json`, `formatted-json`:
    - `code42 alert-rules list`
    - `code42 legal-hold list`
    - `code42 legal-hold show`
    - `code42 security-data saved-search list`

### Removed

- The `write-to` command for `security-data` and `alerts` command groups.
