# Managing Detection List Users

Use the departing-employee commands to add or remove employees on that that list, or update the details for a user. To
see a list of all the users currently in your organization, you can export a list from the
[Users action menu](https://support.code42.com/Administrator/Cloud/Administration_console_reference/Users_reference#Action_menu).

## Get CSV template
To add multiple users to the Departing Employees list:

1. Generate a CSV template. Below is an example command for generating a template to use to add employees to the Departing
Employees list. Once generated, the CSV file is saved to your current working directory.

```bash
code42 departing-employee bulk generate-template add
```

2. Use the CSV template to enter the employees' information. Only the Code42 username is required. If added,
the departure date must be in yyyy-MM-dd format. Note: you are only able to add departure dates during the `add`
operation. If you don't include `--departure-date`, you can only add one later by removing and then re-adding the
employee.

3. Save the CSV file.

## Add users to the Departing Employees list

Once you have entered the employees' information in the CSV file, use the bulk add command with the CSV file path to
add multiple users at once. For example:

```bash
code42 departing-employee bulk add /Users/astrid.ludwig/add_departing_employee.csv
```

## Remove users
You can remove one or more users from the High Risk Employees list. Use `code42 departing-employee remove` to remove a
single user.

To remove multiple users at once:

1. Create a CSV file with one username per line.

2. Save the file to your current working directory.

3. Use the bulk remove command. For example:

```bash
code42 high-risk-employee bulk remove /Users/matt.allen/remove_high_risk_employee.csv
```
