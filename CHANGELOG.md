### Fixed

- Bug where `code42 legal-hold show` would error when terminal was too small.

- Fixed bug in `departing_employee bulk add` command that allowed invalid dates to be passed without validation.

### Changed

- The follow commands now print a nicer error message when trying to remove a user who is not on the list:
    - `code42 departing-employee remove`

- `-i` (`--incremental`) has been removed, use `-c` (`--use-checkpoint`) with a string name for the checkpoint instead.

- The code42cli has been migrated to the [click](https://click.palletsprojects.com) framework. This brings:
    - BREAKING CHANGE: Commands that accept multiple values for the same option now must have the option flag provided before each value:
        use `--option value1 --option value2` instead of `--option value1 value2` (which was previously possible).
    - Cosmetic changes to error messages, progress bars, and help message formatting.

- The `print` command on the `security-data` and `alerts` command groups has been replaced with the `search` command.
    This was a name change only, all other functionality remains the same.

- A profile created with the `--disable-ssl-errors` flag will now correctly not verify SSL certs when making requests. A warning message is printed
    each time the CLI is run with a profile configured this way, as it is not recommended.

- The `path` positional argument for bulk `generate-template` commands is now an option (`--p/-p`).

- Below `search` subcommands accept argument `--format/-f` to display result in formats `csv`, `table`, `json`, `raw-json`:
    - Default output format is changed to `table` format from `raw-json`, returns a paginated response.
    All properties would be displayed by default except when using `-f table`.
    Pass `--include-all` when using `table` to view all non-nested top-level properties.
    - `code42 alerts search`
    - `code42 security-data search`
    - `code42 security-data saved-search list`
    - `code42 legal-hold list`
    - `code42 alert-rules list`

### Added

- `--or-query` option added to `security-data search` and `alerts search` commands which combines the provided filter arguments into an 'OR' query instead of the default 'AND' query.

- `--password` option added to `profile create` and `profile update` commands, enabling creating profiles while bypassing the interactive password prompt.

- Profiles can now save multiple alert and file event checkpoints. The name of the checkpoint to be used for a given query should be passed to `-c` (`--use-checkpoint`).

- `-y/--assume-yes` option added to `profile delete` and `profile delete-all` commands to not require interactive prompt.

- Below subcommands accept argument `--format/-f` to display result in formats `csv`, `table`, `json`, `formatted-json`:
    - `code42 alert-rules list`
    - `code42 legal-hold list`
    - `code42 legal-hold show`
    - `code42 security-data saved-search list`
