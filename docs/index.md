The Code42 command-line interface (CLI) tool offers a way to interact with your Code42 environment without using the
Code42 console or making API calls directly. For example, you can use it to extract Code42 data for use in a security
information and event management (SIEM) tool or manage users on the High Risk Employees list or Departing Employees
list.

## Requirements
To use the Code42 CLI, you must have:

* A [Code42 product plan](https://code42.com/r/support/product-plans) that supports the feature or functionality for your use case
* Endpoint monitoring enabled in the Code42 console
* Python version 3.6 and later installed
